# Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) Viewer and Analyzer

## Overview

This project is an open-source Python-based tool designed to perform Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) analysis with the same precision and accuracy as High-Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC). The tool provides a comprehensive platform for visualizing and analyzing TLC plates, particularly useful in the screening of medicinal cannabinoids. It offers the convenience of smartphone integration for quantitative evaluation of chromatographic analyses.

## Features

- **High Precision Analysis**: Achieve results comparable to HPTLC.
- **Smartphone Integration**: Use your smartphone camera to capture TLC plates and perform quantitative analysis.
- **Automated Analysis**: Automatic detection and quantification of analyte spots.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use graphical interface for visualizing TLC results.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Analyze TLC results in real-time using your smartphone.
- **Open Source**: Fully customizable and extendable for specific research needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Flask (for optional web-based interface)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- TensorFlow (for optional advanced image processing and machine learning tasks)
- Your smartphone's camera (for capturing TLC plates)

### Usage

Capturing Images:

Use your smartphone camera to capture a clear image of the TLC plate.
Ensure consistent lighting and minimal reflection for best results.
Image Upload:

Upload the image to the tool via the graphical user interface (GUI) or the web interface.


Analysis:

The tool will automatically detect the spots on the TLC plate.
Quantitative analysis will be performed, providing data on the concentration of each analyte.



Visualization:

View the results in the GUI or export them as a CSV or image file.
Generate visual reports that can be used for further research or documentation.
